# swagger-express-mw-test

A test drive of `swagger-express-middleware` with an eye towards using a Swagger/OpenAPI spec to provide default functionality while allowing developers to override the defaults as needed.

Spec out more endpoints in PushPress.yaml and they will be added as mocks. Override the defaults by creating the endpoints.

Add more validation by adding requirements to the parameters in PushPress.yaml. Override the defaults by creating custom validation.
